# PLR
**PLR (Pentest Learning Record)** — my personal journal for learning penetration testing fundamentals and practices.  
Here I record technologies, vulnerabilities, lab exercises, notes, and learning progress.

## About the Project
This repository is my personal record of learning penetration testing. The purpose is to gather in one place:
- Topic notes (network stack, web, applications, authentication, cryptography, etc.)
- Explanations of vulnerabilities (focusing on understanding, not just exploitation)
- Lab exercises and walkthroughs (screenshots, logs, outcomes)
- Checklists, cheat-sheets, and review plans

This project is about **safe** and **legal** pentesting — only in controlled labs or systems with explicit permission.

---

## Goals and Approach
- **Understanding**: not just "how to do it" but "why it works/why it breaks".  
- **Practice**: short, focused lab tasks with clear goals.  
- **Repeatability**: every lesson/lab can be repeated independently.  
- **Ethics**: follow laws and rules — no unauthorized attacks.  

---

## Roadmap
A rough learning path (to be updated as I progress):

1. Networking basics (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP(S))  
2. Linux for pentesters (bash, processes, permissions, logs)  
3. Basics of Python/SQL for scripting and analysis  
4. Introduction to Web Security (OWASP Top 10)  
5. Authentication & Authorization (sessions, JWT, OAuth)  
6. SQLi, XSS, CSRF — theory + safe labs  
7. Recon & scanning (nmap, enum tools)  
8. Exploitation in controlled environments  
9. Post-exploitation & evidence gathering  
10. Methodologies: PTES, OSCP-style practice, reporting

## Repository Structure
Suggested folder layout (expand as content grows):

```
/README.md
/notes/                   # notes and cheat sheets
/labs/                    # labs (instructions, steps, results)
  /web/                   # web-related labs
  /network/               # networking exercises
/scripts/                 # helper scripts (analysis, parsing)
/tools/                   # tools, configs
/resources/               # links, books, cheatsheets
/reports/                 # sample reports (formats, templates)
/LICENSE
```

## How to Use
1. Start with `notes/` for theory.  
2. Before running any lab, read its **Prerequisites** section.  
3. Labs should only run in isolated environments: VMs, containers, local labs.  
4. Scripts are marked with warnings; never run them on unauthorized systems.  

---

## Learning Resources
(Add your favorite books, blogs, and courses here)  
Some useful areas: OWASP, networking RFCs, official tool docs (nmap, burp, wireshark), safe CTF platforms (Vulnhub, HackTheBox labs, PortSwigger Academy).  

---

## Safety and Ethics
**Important guidelines:**

- All content here is for **educational purposes only**.  
- Do not perform attacks/exploits on systems without **explicit permission**.  
- Always use isolated labs (VMs, Docker, test environments).  
- Never publish private data or active-use exploits.  
- Follow disclosure policies when doing bug bounty or responsible disclosure.  

Breaking these rules may have legal consequences. This project is for skill development, not illegal activity.

---

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome!  
Please follow these rules:
- Fixes (typos, docs, formatting) are always appreciated.  
- Add labs only with clear environment setup and marked difficulty/risk.  
- No active 0-day or illegal exploitation materials.  
- Use Pull Request templates (what, why, test notes).  

---

## Example Note Template
Each note should contain:
- **Title**  
- **Short description** — why this matters  
- **Theory (short)**  
- **Example or lab task** (non-destructive)  
- **Sources / references**  
- **Date & tags** (e.g., web, auth, beginner)
